I’ve created this blog to document technical details about changes and hurdles that have been encountered during the development of the website, [John VanOrange](http://johnvanorange.com).

If you are not aware, John VanOrange is an image hosting site.
The primary purpose is to store images (generally with funny content) and then display random images back to the user.
A user can then keep viewing random image after random image. The site is powered by a LAMP stack running PHP.

Eventually I plan to document the various technical areas of the site and give some information on why it works the way it works, and changes I’ve had to make as it has grown.
